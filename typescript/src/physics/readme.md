- Phases of matter
    - Solid
        - Incompressible. Fixed Volume and Density.
    - Grain
        - 45 degree angle of repose.
        - Variable amount of content from 0-1.
    - Liquid
        - Incompressible. Fixed Volume and Density.
        - Flows proportional to a viscosity property.
    - Gas
        - Variable Mass.
        - Pressure is a function of Temperature and mass.
